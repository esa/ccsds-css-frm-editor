Version 4.2.2 from TBD
- Address Marcins changes for XSD export

Version 4.2.1 from 17.12.2020
- adapted frm.xsl to have nice ASN.1 formatting in Word imported HTML
- Added tooltip for the FunctionalResourceModel node to list the contained FRs
- handle references of SAP and Ancillary interface 
- All references (Local Type Reference, SAP and Ancillary Interface) are now resolved to local FRM elements on save of the FRM file. 
  All actions are logged, in case a reference cannot be resolved there is a warning in Eclipse Error Log
 - Versioning has been adapted: if a version is specified in the form of the PED, the OID and version is calculated based on the given version 

Version 4.2.0 from 30.06.2020
- create XSD from FRM
- Support Functional Resource Strata

Version 4.1.14 from 25.05.2020
- forced feature version into plug-ins

Version 4.1.13 from 25.05.2020
- generate valid choice values for added elements
- correct exception resulting in not generated ASN.1 file

Version 4.1.12 from 29.04.2020
- increased all MANIFEST versions, apparently ASN.1 generation does not work because of method not found exception

Version 4.1.11 from 29.04.2020
- ASN.1 name generation changes '_' to '-' and . to Dot for names
- When an FR is dragged from one FRM file to another, the type references are updated
  to the ASN.1 module of the target FRM file. The matching of type definitions is done by name


Version 4.1.10 from 31.03.2020
- Removed ValueType suffix in ASN.1 in order not to break types declared in FR general module.

Version 4.1.9 from 30.03.2020
- Corrected ASN.1 generation of Permitted Alphabet constraint

Version 4.1.8 from 5.11.2019
- Increased ccsds.fr.model.editor manifest version to support correct installation on top of older versions 

Version 4.1.7 from 31.10.2019
- Generate single value constraints from SimpleSizeConstrainedType (e.g. OctetString) 
- ASN.1 generation: remove _, /, an\ from names
- ASN.1 generation: Add tags to choices to avoid ambiguity
- ASN.1 generation suppresses element names for children of SET OF if the elements have a type specification (jASN.1 limitation)
- OID offset for FR Sets

Version 4.1.6 from 10.9.2019
- When generating ASN.1, update the type definition field unconditionally, i.e. overwrite what's there

Version 4.1.5 from 6.9.2019
- Corrected the order of shown Parameter, Directives and Events for an FR. Now they are shown in PED order.

Version 4.1.4 from 5.9.2019
- Corrected setting the Type Definition from the generated ASN.1 for empty Type Definitions

Version 4.1.3 from 19.8.2019
- Corrected missing single value constraints for local type reference
- added comment field for element definition and type definition

Version 4.1.2 from TBD
- Corrected pre-setting the TypeDefinition name for FRM files opened at eclipse start 
- Adding of SAPs and Ancillary Interfaces corrected for Functional Resources for the Tree Editor 

Version 4.1.1 from November 2018
- Changed Range Constraints to accept Strings as min / max to support something like (1E-5 .. 1E-4)
- Preset the new Named Value children of Enums with the next number
- Preset the name of new TypeDefinitions with the classifier of the parent with a capitalised first letter

Version 4.1.0 from October 2018
- added type OID for P/E/D, Event/Values and Directive/Qualifiers
- added type model and FRM ASN.1 type module generation 

Version 4.0.0 from 09.05.2018
- Added support for Functional Resource Sets, Service Access Points and Ancillary Interfaces.
- Graphical support for the above features has been added, including a detailed FR diagram for documentation purposes.

Version 3.0.7 from 08.11.2017
- Edit OIDs in a simple text field.

Version 3.0.6 from 01.11.2016
- Added search for functional resource tree. Use a simplified regular expression syntax for search, e.g. *Cfdp

Version 3.0.5 from 09.03.2016
- remove the version OID bit for FRs


Version 3.0.4 from 03.03.2016
- optional OID for all FRM elements

Version 3.0.3 from 16.02.2016
- Classifier is now mandatory, String Identifier optional
- the Classifier is used as label in the navigation tree
- the Classifier is used in the model transformation

Version 3.0.2 from 02.02.2016
Changed Directives to have a Qualifier
Changed Events to have 0..* Values
name -> String Identifier
outstanding: uses -> data flow

Version 3.0.1 from 16.11.2015
- removed the monitored attribute from Parameter

Version 3.0.0 from 13.11.2015

- added 0..1 Qualifier for Directives and Events
- 0..1 Guard Condition for Directives and Configured Parameters
- added Short Name for all FRelements
- changed Parameter/Controlled to Parameter/Configured
- Validation: Configured Parameters must have a guard condition - TBC, this does not sound correct?!
- External OID for Parameters and Events (e.g. production-status OID from the css.csts.framework sub-branch
- Updated OID generation to handle different versions and to ignore external OIDs. The key to be the same element (e.g. Parameter) in a different version is the name
- Added OID tooltips for OIDs showing decorated OIDs like iso(1).identifiedOrganisation(3).standard(112).ccsds(4)  
- Renamed plug-ins to eclipse standard convention - remove old plug-ins before installation!!!
