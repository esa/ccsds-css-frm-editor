Version 4.1.8 from 5.11.2019
- Increased ccsds.fr.model.editor manifest version to support correct installation on top of older versions 

Version 4.1.7 from 31.10.2019
- Generate single value constraints from SimpleSizeConstrainedType (e.g. OctetString) 
- ASN.1 generation: remove _, /, an\ from names
- ASN.1 generation: Add tags to choices to avoid ambiguity
- ASN.1 generation suppress element names for children of SET OF if the elements have a type specification (jASN.1 limitation)
- OID offset for FR Sets

Version 4.1.6 from 10.9.2019
- When generating ASN.1, update the type definition field unconditionally, i.e. overwrite what's there

Version 4.1.5 from 6.9.2019
- Corrected the order of shown Parameter, Directives and Events for an FR. Now they are shown in PED order.

Version 4.1.4 from 5.9.2019
- Corrected setting the Type Definition from the generated ASN.1 for empty Type Definitions

Version 4.1.3 from 19.8.2019
- Corrected missing single value constraints for local type reference
- added comment field for element definition and type definition

Version 4.1.2 from TBD
- Corrected pre-setting the TypeDefinition name for FRM files opened at eclipse start 
- Adding of SAPs and Ancillary Interfaces corrected for Functional Resources for the Tree Editor 

Version 4.1.1 from November 2018
- Changed Range Constraints to accept Strings as min / max to support something like (1E-5 .. 1E-4)
- Preset the new Named Value children of Enums with the next number
- Preset the name of new TypeDefinitions with the classifier of the parent with a capitalised first letter

Version 4.1.0 from October 2018
- added type OID for P/E/D, Event/Values and Directive/Qualifiers
- added type model and FRM ASN.1 type module generation 

Version 4.0.0 from 09.05.2018
- Added support for Functional Resource Sets, Service Access Points and Ancillary Interfaces.
- Graphical support for the above features has been added, including a detailed FR diagram for documentation purposes.

Version 3.0.7 from 08.11.2017
- Edit OIDs in a simple text field.

Version 3.0.6 from 01.11.2016
- Added search for functional resource tree. Use a simplified regular expression syntax for search, e.g. *Cfdp

Version 3.0.5 from 09.03.2016
- remove the version OID bit for FRs


Version 3.0.4 from 03.03.2016
- optional OID for all FRM elements

Version 3.0.3 from 16.02.2016
- Classifier is now mandatory, String Identifier optional
- the Classifier is used as label in the navigation tree
- the Classifier is used in the model transformation

Version 3.0.2 from 02.02.2016
Changed Directives to have a Qualifier
Changed Events to have 0..* Values
name -> String Identifier
outstanding: uses -> data flow

Version 3.0.1 from 16.11.2015
- removed the monitored attribute from Parameter

Version 3.0.0 from 13.11.2015

- added 0..1 Qualifier for Directives and Events
- 0..1 Guard Condition for Directives and Configured Parameters
- added Short Name for all FRelements
- changed Parameter/Controlled to Parameter/Configured
- Validation: Configured Parameters must have a guard condition - TBC, this does not sound correct?!
- External OID for Parameters and Events (e.g. production-status OID from the css.csts.framework sub-branch
- Updated OID generation to handle different versions and to ignore external OIDs. The key to be the same element (e.g. Parameter) in a different version is the name
- Added OID tooltips for OIDs showing decorated OIDs like iso(1).identifiedOrganisation(3).standard(112).ccsds(4)  
- Renamed plug-ins to eclipse standard convention - remove old plug-ins before installation!!!
