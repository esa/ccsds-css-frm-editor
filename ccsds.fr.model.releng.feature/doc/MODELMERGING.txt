Recipe tested with -JP-T1Plus-2020-03-17:
1) Order the types in the general module of the two FRM files to have the same common order as far as possible (at the beginning)
Insert in the source dummy type until all types of the source FRM, but not in the target FRM, get a 'new' index, i.e. the last target type index + 1.

2) Copy with drag and drop the types from the target to the source FRM

3) Load the source FRM in the target FRM (context menu 'Load Resource')

4) drag and drop the FR Sets of the source FRM tot he target FRM

Do the search and replace as described below to correct the type refernces from the source FRM file to the target FRM file.

If SAP references need to be updated (still point to the source FRM), it is suggested to add all FR sets from the source to the target 
at index 1 and replace similar like below the references for types.


Problem: When dragging FRs form one FRM file to another, local references will become a reference to the source FRM file in the target FRM file.

Wrong:
          <type xsi:type="frtypes:TypeReferenceLocal">
            <typeDefinition href="functionalResources-JP-T1Plus-2020-03-17-HD.frm#//@asnTypeModule/@typeDefinition.0"/>
          </type>
          
Correct:
		
		<type xsi:type="frtypes:TypeReferenceLocal" typeDefinition="//@asnTypeModule/@typeDefinition.0"/>          

Solution: Search and Replace with eclipse regular expression search in the FRM XML file:

Type references:

Search:
>\R[\s]*<typeDefinition href="[\S]*\.frm#//@asnTypeModule/@typeDefinition.(\d+)*"/>\R[\s]*</type>

Replace with, attention, a space at the beginning:
 typeDefinition="//@asnTypeModule/@typeDefinition.$1"/>
