	<parameter typeDefinition="SEQUENCE (SIZE (1)) OF IntUnsigned (0 .. 192)" name="asm-correlation-error" SemanticDefinition="This parameter reports the number of symbols in the most recently received ASM that are different from the nominal ASM pattern. When comparing these numbers, one needs to take into consideration whether the synchronization is done on the (pre Viterbi decoder) symbol stream or on the (post Viterbi decoder) bit stream.&#xA;The frame synchronization is also used to remove the phase ambiguity of some modulation schemes. To that end, the correlation process is performed both for the standard ASM pattern and its inversion.&#xA;A given implementation will specify if the the synchronization is performed in the symbol or bit domain. This shall be recorded in the Service Agreement." oidBit="1"/>

It can take on the following values:&#xA;- 'locked' - The synchronizer has found at least two Attached Sync Markers with the expected number of symbols or bits between them and with each ASM having a correlation error that is lower than the configured threshold;&#xA;- 'verify' - the frame synchronizer has found one ASM in the symbol or bit stream with the correlation error lower than the configured threshold and is looking for a second ASM at the expected number of symbols or bits after the first ASM; if such ASM is found, the lock status changes to 'locked'; if no ASM is found where expected, the lock status changes to 'not locked'; if an ASM is found, but at a larger distance in terms of symbols or bits than expected, that newly found ASM will be the reference for searching the next verification ASM;&#xA;- not locked - the frame synchronizer did not find any ASM with a correlation error below the correlation error.

If the frames are not RS encoded, then the FECW is checked and frames for which the result of this check is negative are considered erred.
