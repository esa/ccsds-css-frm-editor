When the Automatic Gain Control (AGC) is in coherent mode and the modulation scheme uses a remnant carrier, then the reported level refers to the carrier power. In all other cases, the reported level refers to the total signal power. " oidBit="2"/>
	<parameter typeDefinition="SEQUENCE (SIZE (1)) OF IntUnsigned (1 ..  1000)" name="system-noise-temperature" SemanticDefinition="This parameter reports the operating system noise temperature in K derived from the noise density observed at the receiver input. As such, it takes into account all contributions to the noise temperature such as antenna microwave component, atmospheric noise and cosmic microwave background noise. The noise temperature varies with weather conditions and antenna elevation due to variation of the path length through the atmosphere and ground noise received by the antenna side lobes." oidBit="3"/>

If the angle reported is 0 degrees, then the full power is received via the LHC channel. At 45 degrees, the power in the LHC and RHC channels is equal, as if the input signal were linearly polarized. At 90 degrees, the full power is received with RHC polarization.&#xA;Only stations supporting concurrent reception of LHC and RHC polarization provide this information.
