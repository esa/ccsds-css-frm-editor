It can take on three values:&#xA;- 'timely online'  - the timely online delivery mode limits the size of the backlog of not yet delivered data that is allowed to accumulate by discarding data that cannot be delivered within a certain time. Furthermore, when data is discarded, it is discarded ‘in&#xA;chunks’, i.e., as a OCFs extracted from a sufficiently large block of contiguous frames rather than as OCFs from random frames here and there; in general, this approach maximizes the usefulness of the data that is delivered.&#xA;- 'complete online' - this delivery mode attempts to deliver the OCFs having the user selected characteristics from all acquired frames, in order, with minimum delay consistent with the available ground communications bandwidth. To that end, the service provider has a buffer be sufficiently large to deal with communications service delays, outages, and bandwidth limitations;&#xA;- 'offline' - in this delivery mode, the provider side buffer enables data to be delivered hours or days after their acquisition.
