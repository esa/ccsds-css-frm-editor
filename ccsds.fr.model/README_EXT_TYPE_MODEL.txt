The frtype ecore model has been defined in a separate ecore model. to use it finally in the FRM editor,
the following apporach was taken.

1) Define the ecore model in a separate plugin and generate teh three EMF plugins
2) Re-load the FRM genmodel and reference the frtype genmodel as an external generator model
3) Create the EEF architecture for the frtype modle (put the EEF models into the ccsds.fr.type.model.edit/models/frtypes.components
4) Update the extension points of the ccsds.fr.type.model.edit plu-in as generated by EEF\
5) duplicate the org.eclipse.ui.views.properties.tabbed.propertySections extensions and replace the 
	contributorId of the frtype editor with the one of the FRM editor contributorId="ccsds.FunctionalResourceModel.properties"
	Otherwise the property pages of the FRM editor are empty for objects of the frtype model.
